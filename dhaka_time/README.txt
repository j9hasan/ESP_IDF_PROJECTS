This code is for an ESP32 device that connects to a WiFi network and obtains the current date and time using the SNTP (Simple Network Time Protocol) service. It initializes the WiFi connection with the specified SSID and password, then sets up SNTP for time synchronization. Once connected to the WiFi and synchronized with the SNTP server, it continuously retrieves the current date and time and prints it every second. The code demonstrates how to initialize WiFi, set up SNTP, and obtain the current date and time on an ESP32 device.
