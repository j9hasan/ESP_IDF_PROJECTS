This code is an example of using the Lightweight IP (LwIP) SNTP (Simple Network Time Protocol) client in an ESP32 application to synchronize the device's time with an NTP server. Here's a breakdown of the main components and functionalities:

1. **Header Includes**: Includes necessary header files for the ESP32, FreeRTOS, event handling, logging, time-related functions, and SNTP.

2. **Global Variables**:
   - `boot_count`: Tracks the number of times the ESP32 has restarted. It's stored in RTC memory to maintain its value across deep sleep cycles.

3. **Function Declarations**:
   - `obtain_time`: Initializes the SNTP client and waits for the time to be synchronized with the NTP server.
   - `initialize_sntp`: Configures the SNTP client with the NTP server address and sets the operating mode and callback function for time synchronization events.
   - `time_sync_notification_cb`: Callback function invoked upon a time synchronization event.

4. **`app_main` Function**:
   - Increments `boot_count` and logs the current boot count.
   - Checks if the time is already set. If not, it connects to Wi-Fi and initializes the SNTP client to obtain the time.
   - Demonstrates adjusting the system time if the `CONFIG_SNTP_TIME_SYNC_METHOD_SMOOTH` option is enabled.
   - Sets the time zone and prints the current date/time in different time zones.
   - Waits for time adjustment to complete if using the SMOOTH SYNC method.
   - Enters deep sleep mode for a specified duration.

5. **`obtain_time` Function**:
   - Initializes the necessary components (NVS flash, network interface, event loop).
   - Configures SNTP to accept NTP offers from the DHCP server.
   - Connects to Wi-Fi and initializes the SNTP client.
   - Waits for the time to be synchronized with the NTP server.

6. **`initialize_sntp` Function**:
   - Configures the SNTP client operating mode and NTP server address.
   - Sets the time synchronization mode and initializes the SNTP client.

This code snippet provides a comprehensive example of how to integrate SNTP functionality into an ESP32 application to obtain accurate time synchronization from NTP servers.
